This is a visualization tool for the incremental construction algorithm of the Delaunay Triangulation created in Python as my final project for COMP 4202.
This application uses my own implementation of the triangulation algorithm that can also be found here.
File Guide:
- COMP 4202 Final Project.pdf: This is the written report I created for this project and it goes over issues faced during development and testing
- Triangulation.py: This file contains the triangulation implementation as used for the runtime testing
- VisualizationVersionOfTriangulation.py: This file contains the triangulation implementation that includes the user interface
- RuntimeTesting.py: This file contains the code for initializing and evaluating different test cases for their runtime and number of operations
- Delaunay Triangulation Visualization.exe: This is a standalone application that can be used to see in action the visualization application
